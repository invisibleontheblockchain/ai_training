# 🌐 GHOSTEAM V5 NETWORK CONFIGURATION

## 📍 STATIC OUTBOUND IP ADDRESSES

Your Ghosteam V5 Autonomous MLOps system deployed on Render.com will use these static IP addresses for all outbound network requests:

```
44.229.227.142
54.188.71.94
52.13.128.108
```

## 🔒 SECURITY IMPLICATIONS

### **Firewall Whitelisting**
If you need to configure firewalls or security groups for external services, whitelist these IPs:

**For MLflow Integration:**
- If using external MLflow tracking server
- Database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Redis cache connections

**For External APIs:**
- Third-party ML services
- Data sources
- Webhook notifications
- Monitoring services

### **Network Security Benefits**
✅ **Predictable IP addresses** - No random IP changes
✅ **Security compliance** - Easy to whitelist in corporate firewalls
✅ **Audit trails** - Clear source identification for all requests
✅ **Access control** - Precise network access management

## 🚀 AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM NETWORK USAGE

Your autonomous MLOps system will use these IPs for:

### **Continuous Learning Operations**
- Fetching training data from external sources
- Connecting to external databases
- API calls to data validation services
- Model registry synchronization

### **Predictive Intelligence Features**
- External data enrichment APIs
- Real-time data feeds
- Third-party analytics services
- Performance benchmarking services

### **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Health check notifications
- Performance monitoring APIs
- Alert webhook deliveries
- Log aggregation services

## 📊 DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

When testing your deployed system, these IPs will appear in:
- Server access logs
- API gateway logs
- Database connection logs
- External service audit trails

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES

### **Database Firewall Rules**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL pg_hba.conf example
host    all    ghosteam_user    44.229.227.142/32    md5
host    all    ghosteam_user    54.188.71.94/32     md5
host    all    ghosteam_user    52.13.128.108/32    md5
```

### **AWS Security Group Rules**
```json
{
  "IpPermissions": [
    {
      "IpProtocol": "tcp",
      "FromPort": 5432,
      "ToPort": 5432,
      "IpRanges": [
        {"CidrIp": "44.229.227.142/32"},
        {"CidrIp": "54.188.71.94/32"},
        {"CidrIp": "52.13.128.108/32"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Nginx Access Control**
```nginx
# Allow Ghosteam V5 system access
allow 44.229.227.142;
allow 54.188.71.94;
allow 52.13.128.108;
deny all;
```
