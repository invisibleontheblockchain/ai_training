It checks if the number is 0, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies the number with the factorial of (n-1) using recursion.\n\nExample 2: Fibonacci Series\n\nThe Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Here's how we can use recursion to generate the Fibonacci series up to a certain number:\n\n``",

We then create an array called `arr` with some unsorted values, call the `merge_sort` function on it, and print the sorted array.\n\nStudent: That makes sense. Can you explain how merge sort works?\n\nTA: Sure. The merge sort algorithm works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element. Then, it merges these subarr",

Write a Python function to implement the binary search algorithm using recursion.\n   - Idea: Write a function that takes in an array and a target element as input.

Write unit tests to ensure that your code is functioning correctly.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the common errors and pitfalls in Python programming is essential for developing high-quality code. By following best practices and avoiding common mistakes, you can write efficient, readable, and maintainable code that will be easy to understand for others.",

This can be done by iterating over the list and keeping track of the closest integer found so far. If a new integer is found that is closer than the current closest integer, update the closest integer. This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) compared to the current approach which has a time complexity of O(n).\n\nStudent: I see. So I can modify my function to use a binary search algorithm like this:\n\n```python\ndef round_nearest_int(n: int, li: List[int]) -> int:\n    li.sort",
